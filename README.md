##### The clientY read-only property of the MouseEvent interface provides the vertical coordinate within the application's viewport at which the event occurred (as opposed to the coordinate within the page).
##### For example, clicking on the top edge of the viewport will always result in a mouse event with a clientY value of 0, regardless of whether the page is scrolled vertically.

#### Node: insertBefore() method
##### The insertBefore() method of the Node interface inserts a node before a reference node as a child of a specified parent node.

#### Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
##### The Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY static data property represents the negative Infinity value. 

#### Element: getBoundingClientRect() method
##### The Element.getBoundingClientRect() method returns a DOMRect object providing information about the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.
##### The returned value is a DOMRect object which is the smallest rectangle which contains the entire element, including its padding and border-width. The left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, and height properties describe the position and size of the overall rectangle in pixels.
